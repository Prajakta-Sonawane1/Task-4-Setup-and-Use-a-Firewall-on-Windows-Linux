# Task-4-Setup-and-Use-a-Firewall-on-Windows-Linux
Configure and test basic firewall rules using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) in Kali Linux to understand how firewalls allow or block network traffic.


UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) in Kali Linux helps control inbound and outbound network traffic.
I configured rules to block Telnet (port 23) and allow SSH (port 22).
Telnet traffic was successfully blocked and verified with connection tests.
Finally, I removed the test rule, restoring the default configuration.
This demonstrates how firewall rules help filter unwanted network connections for system security.


Tools Used
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) — default Linux firewall management tool
Telnet — used for testing blocked ports
Terminal — for executing firewall commands
